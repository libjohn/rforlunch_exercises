## Introduction to R workshop: Exercises

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This code supports the [*Introduction to R* / R for Lunch workshop](https://intro2r.library.duke.edu) sponsored by [Rfun](https://rfun.library.duke.edu) and the [Center for Data & Visualization Sciences](https://library.duke.edu/data). The first link leads to a companion website that also links to GitHub repository of supporting code. Meanwhile, and redundantly, this code supports workshop series by combining exercises into one place.
