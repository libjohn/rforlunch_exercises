## Introduction to R workshop: Exercises

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This code supports the [*Introduction to R* / R for Lunch workshop](https://intro2r.library.duke.edu) sponsored by [Rfun](https://rfun.library.duke.edu) and the [Center for Data & Visualization Sciences](https://library.duke.edu/data). The first link leads to a companion website that also links to GitHub repository of supporting code. Meanwhile, and somewhat redundantly, this exercise code supports the workshop series by combining selective exercises and slides into one place.
