Compose a function to take the square root, `sqrt()`, of a number which is multiplied by 10

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
sqrt_by_10 <- function(my_x) {
  sqrt(my_x * 10)
}
```

Execute the function

```{r}
sqrt_by_10(3)

sqrt(3 * 10)
```

Compose a function that multiplies two numbers

```{r}
multiply_two_numbers <- function(x, y) {
  (x * y)
}
```

Execute the function

```{r}
starwars |> 
  mutate(new_number = multiply_two_numbers(mass, height), .after = mass)
```
