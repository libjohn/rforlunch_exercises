## What is reproducibility?

\

Recreate the exact results of a computational analysis or experiment using the same data, code, and methods as the original study.

\

Someone else should be able to follow the same steps and obtain the same outcomes.

## What is workflow

A structured sequence of data processing, analysis, and computational steps used to transform raw data into meaningful results or insights.\

Typically involves:

-   Data acquisition and preparation
-   Processing and analysis steps
-   Generation of outputs (e.g., results, visualizations)
-   Documentation of the process

## Quarto

Quarto is a scientific publishing system that enables reproducible workflows and simplifies report generation.

\

Quarto uses notebooks as the primary document format.

\

RStudio and Quarto were introduced and discussed in previous sessions.

## Notebooks

\

A notebook is a document containing code and natural language

-   Jupyter (.ipynb)
-   Quarto document (.qmd) (next-gen R Markdown)

## What we'll learn

Streamlining reproducible workflows - from code to reports (slides, PDF, dahsboards, etc.) that enable reproducible workflows and simplify generating reports from code.

\
Take control of your reports and can reduce dependencies on subscription hosts.

## RStudio configurations

-   Demo a Quarto Manuscript
    -   [Blank Slate Approach to **reproducibility**: RStudio **settings**](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/get-started/#blank-slate)
    -   **BUILD** `quarto render` [([Render styles](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/))]{style="color: grey; font-size: x-large;"}
    -   `_quarto.yaml` [([Example at Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/front-matter.html))]{style="font-size: x-large;"}

## Prerequisites

-   Already installed _tinytex_ on Windows via Terminal [(takes several minutes)]{style="color: grey; font-size: x-large;"}
    -   Rstudio \> Terminal \> `quarto install tinytex`
-   Use **RStudio Project** protocol 
    -   Use git version control 
    -   Use {renv} to back-up specific package versions
    -   Use GitHub to manage versions
    -   Link GitHub to Zenodo to mint DOIs and archive milestones [([Instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content))]{style="font-size: x-large;"}

## Prerequisites . . .

\
Bibliography

\
Quarto leverages bib files from from bibliographic reference managers [(Zotero, EndNote)]{style="color: grey;"} and imports relevant citation data from DOIs

-   references.bib - **bibliography file**

## SHOW

Clone [example](https://github.com/quarto-ext/manuscript-template-rstudio) from GitHub

-   RStudio \> Project \> new Project \> Quarto Manuscript  \ ([documentation example](https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/authoring/rstudio.html))

-   [Quarto documentation on Manuscripts](https://quarto.org/docs/manuscripts/)

## Hands-on

#### Create a Quarto webSite

> `RStudio: File > New Project > New Directory > Quarto Website`

#### Create a Quarto Manuscript

    RStudio: File > New Project > New Directory > Quarto Manuscript

[Or, follow these [directions](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/quarto-jsm24/4-manuscripts/4-manuscripts.html#/getting-started) from Çetinkaya-Rundel & Wickham]{style="font-size: xx-large;"}

## Dashboards

Dashboards: Just like a standard quarto document ([docs](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/)). YAML -\> `format: dashboard`

-   Interactivity
    -   Simple interactivity with [HTML Widgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/)
    -   Advanced interactivity with Shiny (server-side) and Observable (client-side)
